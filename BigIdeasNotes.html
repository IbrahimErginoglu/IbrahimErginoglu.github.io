    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #1</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1: Collabration:</strong> Collaboration in coding helps us incorporate diverse perspectives and reduce biases in our code.< br >
                                              There are various methods to collaborate effectively with your coding partners.</p>
       
        <p><strong>1.2: Program Function and Purpose:</strong>  Computer innovations, whether digital or physical, solve problems and allow us to do things previously impossible. We can understand these innovations by asking why they exist and what problems they address. Inputs can be tactile, audible, visual, or text-based (including numerical). Outputs are triggered by inputs. A program consists of statements executed according to programming rules, with code segments being key parts.
    </p>
        
        <p><strong>1.3: Program Design and Development:</strong> Program development involves identifying constraints, user needs, and requirements. Developers brainstorm, plan, and build programs, often working in teams. Each member’s contribution should be documented for recognition. Many languages support comments for easy documentation.
    </p>
        
        <p><strong>1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors:</strong> Programming errors include logic, syntax, runtime, and overflow errors. Logic errors come from algorithm mistakes, syntax errors from typos, runtime errors from crashes (like division by zero), and overflow errors from calculations exceeding defined ranges. Test cases, hand tracing, debugging, and visualization help identify and fix errors. Syntax errors are easier to find, while logic errors are more complex. Testing starts early and is crucial for refining programs.

    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #2</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1: Binary Numbers:</strong> Data is represented using bits, where each bit is either a 0 or 1. A byte consists of 8 bits. The binary system is based on two digits: "1" signifies that an electrical signal in a computer is on, while "0" indicates that it is off.

</p>
        <p><strong>2.2: Data Compression:</strong> Lossless compression algorithms reduce the number of bits for storage or transmission while ensuring that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed. In contrast, lossy compression algorithms significantly reduce the number of bits, but only an approximate version of the original data can be recovered. Data compression helps optimize storage space and transmission time.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.3: Extracting Information:</strong> Working with data sets presents challenges such as cleaning the data, handling missing or invalid data, and combining multiple data sources.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.3: Using Programs With Data:</strong> Programs are used iteratively and interactively to process data, enabling users to gain insights and knowledge. Programmers can also use these tools to filter and clean digital data.

    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #3.1 - 3.5</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1: Variables and Assignments:</strong> A variable is an abstraction used to store values in a program. Some programming languages support different types such as numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings, all of which can be stored in variables. The values of variables can be changed, and the "←" symbol is used for assigning new values.
</p>
        <p><strong>3.2: Data Abstraction:</strong> An index allows us to reference elements in a list or string using natural numbers. Data abstraction involves separating the essential properties of a data type from its specific details. Lists serve as examples of data abstraction, helping to simplify and streamline the development and maintenance of programs.
</p>
        <p><strong>3.3: Mathematical Expressions:</strong> An algorithm is a series of steps designed to solve a particular problem. Algorithms can be expressed in natural language, diagrams, or pseudocode. They are built using sequences, decisions (selection), and loops (iteration).
</p>
        <p><strong>3.4: Strings:</strong>Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text in programming. A substring is a portion of an existing string. Strings are often used for names, words, or sentences, and can be manipulated by combining, splitting, or searching through them.
</p>   
       <p><strong>3.5: Boolean Expressions:</strong>A Boolean represents either true or false. It can take a value of "1" (true) or "0" (false). Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT are commonly used in conditionals and loops.

        <h2>Big Idea #3.6 - 3.10</h2>
        <p><strong>3.6: Conditionals:</strong>Conditionals allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions. Using if, else if, and else, different code can be executed depending on the result of Boolean expressions. For example, if a condition is true, a specific action occurs; otherwise, other conditions are checked.
</p>
        <p><strong>3.7: Nested Conditionals:</strong>Nested conditionals happen when one conditional statement is placed inside another. They are used to handle more complex decision-making scenarios.
</p>
        <p><strong>3.8: İterations:</strong> Iteration enables a specific part of an algorithm to run repeatedly. Loops carry out a block of code multiple times depending on a condition, like in REPEAT UNTIL(condition) or FOR loops. If the condition is true at the start, the loop does not run.
</p>
         <p><strong>3.9: Developing Algorithms:</strong> Algorithms can be created from a concept, by merging pre-existing algorithms, or by altering current solutions. These step-by-step processes address specific problems and frequently use patterns to enhance efficiency.
</p>
         <p><strong>3.10: Lists:</strong> Lists hold multiple items that can be retrieved through their index positions. Algorithms that manipulate lists often rely on iteration to navigate and handle their elements, making lists an essential component of data abstraction in programming.

        <p><strong>4.1: The internet :</strong>The Internet is a global network of computing devices communicating with each other in some way, whether they're sending emails, downloading files, or sharing websites. The Internet is an open network: any computing device can join as long as they follow the rules of the game. In networking, the rules are known as protocols and they define how each device must communicate with each other. The Internet is powered by many layers of protocols.
