    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #1</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1: Collabration:</strong> Collaboration in coding helps us incorporate diverse perspectives and reduce biases in our code.< br >
                                              There are various methods to collaborate effectively with your coding partners.</p>
       
        <p><strong>1.2: Program Function and Purpose:</strong>  Computer innovations, whether digital or physical, solve problems and allow us to do things previously impossible. We can understand these innovations by asking why they exist and what problems they address. Inputs can be tactile, audible, visual, or text-based (including numerical). Outputs are triggered by inputs. A program consists of statements executed according to programming rules, with code segments being key parts.
    </p>
        
        <p><strong>1.3: Program Design and Development:</strong> Program development involves identifying constraints, user needs, and requirements. Developers brainstorm, plan, and build programs, often working in teams. Each member’s contribution should be documented for recognition. Many languages support comments for easy documentation.
    </p>
        
        <p><strong>1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors:</strong> Programming errors include logic, syntax, runtime, and overflow errors. Logic errors come from algorithm mistakes, syntax errors from typos, runtime errors from crashes (like division by zero), and overflow errors from calculations exceeding defined ranges. Test cases, hand tracing, debugging, and visualization help identify and fix errors. Syntax errors are easier to find, while logic errors are more complex. Testing starts early and is crucial for refining programs.

    <!-- Big Idea 2 -->
    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #2</h2>
        <p><strong>2.1: Binary Numbers:</strong> Data is represented using bits, where each bit is either a 0 or 1. A byte consists of 8 bits. The binary system is based on two digits: "1" signifies that an electrical signal in a computer is on, while "0" indicates that it is off.

</p>
        <p><strong>2.2: Data Compression:</strong> Lossless compression algorithms reduce the number of bits for storage or transmission while ensuring that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed. In contrast, lossy compression algorithms significantly reduce the number of bits, but only an approximate version of the original data can be recovered. Data compression helps optimize storage space and transmission time.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.3: Extracting Information:</strong> Working with data sets presents challenges such as cleaning the data, handling missing or invalid data, and combining multiple data sources.
</p>
        <p><strong>2.3: Using Programs With Data:</strong> Programs are used iteratively and interactively to process data, enabling users to gain insights and knowledge. Programmers can also use these tools to filter and clean digital data.
