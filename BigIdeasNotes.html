    <div class="unit">
        <h2>Big Idea #1</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1: Collabration:</strong> Collaboration in coding helps us incorporate diverse perspectives and reduce biases in our code.< br >
                                              There are various methods to collaborate effectively with your coding partners.</p>
       
        <p><strong>1.2: Program Function and Purpose:</strong>  Computer innovations can be either digital or physical. Many of the conveniences we often overlook are products of computer innovation.
                                              To understand these innovations, we should ask questions such as: Why do they exist? What problems do they address? How do they enable us to do things that were previously impossible?
                                              Input methods can include tactile, audible, visual, and text-based formats, with text also encompassing numerical values. Outputs are generated in response to inputs.
                                              A computer program consists of statements executed based on programming rules, and code segments are integral parts of these programs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.3: Program Design and Development:</strong> Program development involves investigators who need to identify constraints, user concerns, and program requirements. 
                                                                Developers brainstorm, plan, and then create their programs. Programs are often developed by teams, and each member of the team should receive recognition for their contributions.
                                                                Documentation is crucial to track contributions and provide credit. Many programming languages include comment features to aid in documentation without significant hassle.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors:</strong> Errors are an inherent part of programming and come in various forms: logic errors, syntax errors, runtime errors, and overflow errors.
                                                                    Logic errors occur when there are mistakes in the algorithm, while syntax errors are typically caused by typos. Runtime errors, also known as bugs, occur when a program crashes during execution, often due to issues like division by zero.
                                                                    Overflow errors happen when calculations exceed the defined range of values. There are multiple ways to address these errors, including test cases, hand tracing, visualization, debugging, and other output analysis methods. Syntax errors are generally the easiest to identify and fix, while logic errors can be more challenging. 
                                                                    Test methods and hand tracing, especially for loops and smaller programs, are useful for identifying and resolving issues. Programmers should start testing early and consider various inputs to ensure their algorithms function correctly. Testing and refining are ongoing parts of the development process.</p>
